# Basic-Portfolio
My Basic Portfolio Web Page 

Created a Basic Portfolio website to display myself and my work

Including index.html
contact.html
portrait.html
styles.css
and Images

Initial pushes are structural changes made to the html documents and the css page. 

Later pushes are changes directed at the linking of the HTML pages. 
  -Was struggling with the pushes to the index.html page and locating the index.html page rather than the Index.html deleted page.
  
  Edited html documents within Github for Final Changes.
  
  Structured with margins so doesnt work well with differing pixel sizes.
